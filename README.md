# Mechanic Shop Project SQL&JAVA, CS166 UCR

## Description:

This project demonstrates the manipulation and/or selection of Mechanic Shop data through the use of functions (JAVA) and queries (SQL). In the Mechanic shop, there are customers, mechanics, cars, and open/closed service requests, each with their own attributes and relationships with each other. This program prompts a menu with choices that allows for users to either create new customers, cars, etc, or select a list of certain customers/cars/etc that satisfy a certain requirement. A more detailed explanation covering th functionalities of this program can be found in the project.pdf file located in the phase 3 directory.

I completed this project with a partner in approximately 4 weeks as a requirement for my Introduction to Databases class. We did every function together, and also included error handling.
